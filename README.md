# BatteryBufferedEndStationCharging
  
Fast-charging electric buses at bus end-stations can lead to high peak-demand charges for bus operators. A promising method to reduce these peak-demand charges is combining the fast charging station (FCS) with a stationary energy storage unit (SES). This project analyses the potential cost reduction for installing optimally-sized SES at bus FCS on a city scale for different levels of bus-line electrification. The results and method are documented in the following publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.est.2020.101794

### Installing

Apart from the files in this repository, the bus charging curves need to be downloaded from the following source and placed in a folder named "Input" on the same level as the "Main.py" file. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4017198.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4017198)

Alternatively, an input file generated from another source can be loaded. For this purpose, de-serializing the input file with the pickle command should result in a python dictionary object with the following structure, where "BLEL" refers to the bus line electrification level and "ter" to the terminal ID": 
```
Powerprofile[BLEL][ter]{
  'time': <Array of float64>
  'Demand': <Array of float64>
  'Nchargers': <int>
}
```
## Requirements
The code can be run in a python environment containing the following libraries: 
- numpy
- pickle
- pandas
- scipy

All code has been tested on Python version 3.7


## Running the Model/Code
The results are generated by executing the "Main.py" file. The execution time on a 16GB RAM, 1.8GHz machine is approximately 1 hour.
